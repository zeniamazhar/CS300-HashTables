# ðŸ“¸ Converting binary images to RLE and storing in hash table 

I made this program in C++ for my data structures assignment. This program converts binary images to run length encoding strings and makes use of a hash table to store them in different indices, and deals with collisions by using linear probing where the element is placed in the next empty cell after the one where the collision occurred. One can store images and then enter a query to find out if it exists in the hash table, and retrieve it.
